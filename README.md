# VortexAutoDownlaoder
INTRO
This is my first Python project, so be  gentle with me.
-------------------------------------------------------
WHY AND HOW TO USE.
A simple bot that automates the onerous job of repeatedly clicking to download mods one by one via vortex and nexus mods.
This bot simply identifies the presence of the 'download' button on vortex in a predefined space range (made specifically for the 1920x1080 resolution), then clicks it and then after about 8 seconds looks for the 'slow download' button in Nexusmod .
It repeats this interaction endlessly.
Check the file screenshot_test.png if you have problem to find the right region to indetificate the buttons, and try to change the values.

LICENCY.
Feel free to take my project and re-mix it, but don't use it for commercial purpose.
